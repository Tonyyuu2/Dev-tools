# **üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Dev-Tools üë©üèª‚Äçüíª**

Dev-Tools is a professional development tool that helps developers manage their time, keep track of their physical health, and organize their day. It is built with Node.js, Express and React, and offers a variety of features to make development easier, including timers, health checker, kanban board and code journal.

This project was created in less than two weeks by [Lucky Kim](https://github.com/lucky-hw-kim), [Shubham Patel](https://github.com/shubham2295), and [Tony Yu](https://github.com/Tonyyuu2) as part of the final project of Lighthouse Lab's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp curriculum.

# Getting Started

The root file contains two directories: Client and Server. The Client directory contains the front-end, while the Server directory contains the back-end. 

To get started, open both the Client and Server directories in two separate terminal windows and run `npm i` on both windows. 

We used PostgreSQL for the database and to initialize it, please run `npm run db:reset` on the server side terminal window. 

To start the application, run `npm start` on both terminal windows and enjoy~!ü§ó

## Take breaks!

Developers can use the Pomodoro style timer to remind themselves to take breaks between coding sessions, and use the weather widget to check the weather in their current location.
