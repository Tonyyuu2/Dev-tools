# **👨🏻‍💻 Dev-Tools 👩🏻‍💻**

Dev-Tools is a professional development tool that helps developers manage their time, keep track of their physical health, and organize their day. It is built with Node.js, Express and React, and offers a variety of features to make development easier, including timers, health checker, kanban board and code journal.

This project was created in less than two weeks by [Lucky Kim](https://github.com/lucky-hw-kim), [Shubham Patel](https://github.com/shubham2295), and [Tony Yu](https://github.com/Tonyyuu2) as part of the final project of Lighthouse Lab's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp curriculum.

# Getting Started

The root file contains two directories: Client and Server. The Client directory contains the front-end, while the Server directory contains the back-end. 

To get started, open both the Client and Server directories in two separate terminal windows and run `npm i` on both windows. 

We used PostgreSQL for the database and to initialize it, please run `npm run db:reset` on the server side terminal window. 

To start the application, run `npm start` on both terminal windows and enjoy~!🤗
